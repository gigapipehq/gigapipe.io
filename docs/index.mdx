# ðŸ”® Gigapipe Observability 

Gigapipe is a polyglot observability platform designed to unify logs, metrics, and traces under a single, lightspeed OLAP database. 

Unlike traditional observability tools that silo data and require multiple components, Gigapipe's all-in-one approach allows correlation between different data types and formats, enhancing troubleshooting and insight generation for engineering teams, devops and business intelligence.
