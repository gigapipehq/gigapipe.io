Like a durable parquet floor, GigAPI provides rock-solid data foundation for your queries and analytics

> GigAPI by Gigapipe is our twist on future query engines â€“ one where you focus on your data, not your infrastructure, servers or capacity. By combining the performance of DuckDB with cloud-native architecture principles we've created a simple and light solution designed for unlimited time series and analytical datasets that makes traditional server-based OLAP databases feel like costly relics and decimating infrastructure costs by 50-90% without performance loss. All 100% opensource - no open core cloud gimmicks.
