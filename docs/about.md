# Polyglot Observability

Gigapipe a _drop-in_ replacement for **Grafana Cloud** _APIs, formats and protocols_ allowing instant integrations and migrations. 

### Nothing to Install
Ingest any **Observability** signal _(Logs, Metrics, Traces, Profiles)_ using **Opentelemetry** or using any agents you already _trust_.

### Nothing to Learn
Query your **Gigapipe** data using standard query languages and APis like **Loki _LogQL, Prometheus _PromQL, Tempo and Pyroscope**.

### Nothing to Configure
Grafana is API compatible with Gigapipe out of the box. No special plugins required. _We're Loki, Mimir, Tempo and Pyroscope at once._

### Nothing to Reinvent
You can import all of your existing Dashboards and Datasources. _Plug your data and continue where you left off._
