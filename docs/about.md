## Polyglot Observability

Designed as a drop-in replacement for Grafana API formats and protocols, Gigapipe allows instant integrations regardless of data formats. 

### Nothing to Install
Ingest any Observability signal (Logs, Metrics, Traces, Profiles) using Opentelemetry or by keeping the agents they already trust.

### Nothing to Learn
Query your Gigapipe data using standard query languages and APis like Loki _LogQL, Prometheus _PromQL, Tempo and Pyroscope.

### Nothing to Configure
Grafana is compatible with Gigapipe out of the box. No special plugins required. We're Loki, Mimir, Tempo and Pyroscope at once.
