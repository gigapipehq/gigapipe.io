## Installation

### `sources` object

`@rspack/core` exports the [webpack-sources](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-sources) module through `sources`. It provides a set of classes for creating and manipulating source code fragments and source maps. When developing Rspack plugins, you can use these classes to handle and manipulate source code.

```js
import { sources } from '@rspack/core';

const { RawSource } = sources;
const source = new RawSource('console.log("Hello, world!");');
```

For detailed usage, please refer to the [webpack-sources](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-sources) documentation.
