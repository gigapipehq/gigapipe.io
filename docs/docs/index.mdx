      ### Step 2

      Configure your Observability Agent to send Logs, Metrics and Traces to Gigapipe

      ### Step 3

      Access your included Grafana instance to Search and Explore your fresh data.

      ### Step 4

      Sky is the limit. Any example from Grafana Cloud should work as-is in Gigapipe.

### Supported Agents

`@rspack/core` exports the [webpack-sources](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-sources) module through `sources`. It provides a set of classes for creating and manipulating source code fragments and source maps. When developing Rspack plugins, you can use these classes to handle and manipulate source code.

```js
import { sources } from '@rspack/core';

const { RawSource } = sources;
const source = new RawSource('console.log("Hello, world!");');
```

For detailed usage, please refer to the [webpack-sources](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-sources) documentation.
