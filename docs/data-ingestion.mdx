| **APIs**            | - **HTTP/REST API**: For sending logs via HTTP endpoints in JSON or other structured formats. <br/> - **Loki Push API**: For sending logs in Loki-compatible format. |

## Metric Ingestion

Gigapipe supports a wide range of protocols and agents for metric ingestion, making it easy to capture time-series data from popular monitoring tools.

| **Metric Ingestion** | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Protocols**        | - **Prometheus Remote Write**: For direct metric ingestion from Prometheus. <br/> - **Graphite**: For integration with Graphite-compatible sources. <br/> - **OpenTelemetry Metrics**: Standardized metric collection across environments. <br/> - **InfluxDB Line Protocol**: Enables ingestion from InfluxDB-compatible sources. |
| **Agents**           | - **Grafana Agent**: Collects and forwards metrics to Gigapipe/qryn. <br/> - **Telegraf**: InfluxDB’s metrics collection agent, with support for numerous plugins. <br/> - **Prometheus Node Exporter**: For gathering hardware and OS metrics in Prometheus format. <br/> - **Vector**: High-performance collection and forwarding for metrics and logs. <br/> - **Amazon CloudWatch Agent**: Collects and sends system metrics from AWS environments. |
| **APIs**             | - **Prometheus PushGateway**: Used for pushing ephemeral metrics to Gigapipe. <br/> - **HTTP/REST API**: For HTTP-based metric ingestion. <br/> - **Graphite API**: Allows metric ingestion in Graphite format. |

## Trace Ingestion

For distributed tracing, Gigapipe supports popular tracing protocols, providing easy integration for microservices and distributed applications.

| **Trace Ingestion**  | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Protocols**        | - **OpenTelemetry Traces**: Full support for cross-platform distributed tracing. <br/> - **Jaeger**: Popular open-source distributed tracing system for microservices. |
| **Agents**           | - **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Collects trace data and forwards it to qryn/Gigapipe. <br/> - **Jaeger Agent**: Streams trace data directly to qryn-compatible destinations. |
| **APIs**             | - **Jaeger Thrift**: Supports trace ingestion in Jaeger’s Thrift format. <br/> - **HTTP/REST API**: For flexible HTTP-based trace ingestion. |

## Profiling Ingestion

Profiling, a new feature in qryn, provides insights into resource utilization and code execution, making it easier to optimize application performance.

| **Profiling Ingestion** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Protocols**           | - **OpenTelemetry Profiling**: Standardized profiling format to track application resource use. |
| **Agents**              | - **Grafana Agent**: Supports profiling collection alongside logs and metrics. <br/> - **Pyroscope Agent**: Collects profiling data from supported languages like Python and Go. <br/> - **Parca Agent**: Continuous profiling agent for in-depth application performance insights. |
| **APIs**                | - **HTTP/REST API**: For sending profiling data to Gigapipe/qryn. |

Gigapipe’s extensive support for leading protocols, agents, and APIs makes it easy to unify observability data across logs, metrics, traces, and profiling, providing a single source of truth for your infrastructure and applications.
