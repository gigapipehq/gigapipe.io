# Polyglot Observability

> Polyglot comes from Greek _polygl≈çttos_, a combination of **poly** - _"many" or "multi"_ - and **gl≈çtta** for _"language_.

_That's us_. Gigapipe is a Polyglot platform designed around the Observability standards the world already loves üíú

### Independence

Our stack is _protocol compatible_ with many projects and products - _without depending on any_. Our Core and APIs are independently developed and _fully opensource_.

### Solid Performance

Our stack leverages the **ClickHouse** and **DuckDB** OLAP engines for storage and to provide fast analytics and scalable performance. We develop our extensions standing on the shoulders of giants.

### Cloud Alternative

Our prices are different because we are different - and so are our dedicated hosting and VPS partners. _You can still deploy our stack on AWS, if you want to!_
