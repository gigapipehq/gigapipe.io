# 💜 Polyglot Observability

> Polyglot comes from Greek _polyglōttos_, a combination of **poly** - _"many" or "multi"_ - and **glōtta** for _"language_.

_That's us_. Gigapipe is a Polyglot platform designed around the Observability standards the world already loves 💜

### 💎 Independence

Our stack is _protocol compatible_ with many projects and products - _without depending on any_. Our stack and APIs are developed from scratch and _fully opensource_.

### ⚡ Solid Performance

Our stack leverages the **ClickHouse** and **DuckDB** OLAP engines for storage and to provide fast analytics and scalable performance. We develop our extensions standing on the shoulders of giants.

### 🍖 Underdog-ness

Our prices are different because we are different - and so are our dedicated hosting and VPS partners. _You can still deploy our stack on AWS, if you really want to!_
