Gigapipe qryn is a comprehensive observability platform designed to unify logs, metrics, traces and profiles in a single, seamless database. Unlike traditional tools that silo data, Gigapipe's all-in-one approach ensures automatic correlation between different data types, enhancing troubleshooting and insight generation for engineering teams.

Our polyglot observability stack  designed around standards the world already loves 💜

#### ☝️ Why did we create Gigapipe? 

_We created [qryn/gigapipe](https://qryn.dev)_ from the ground up to handle our observability - batteries included! 🔋

> Gigapipe started in 2018 as “cLoki” and gradually evolved from a prototype into a mature, stable and independent observability stack able to act as a drop-in alternative to Grafana Cloud/LGTM and API compatible with multiple query and ingestion formats from popular observability vendors such as Opentelemetry, InfluxDB, Elastic, Datadog and many more. The beauty of Gigapipe is in its simplicity, acting as a lightweight transpiler on top of OLAP SQL storage without reinventing the wheel and offering its users performance, security and full ownership and control of their data without limitations and without obscure formats. Less is more, without giving up any feature.

Gigapipe is an indie opensource underdog actively developed and maintained ⭐

#### ☝️ Why did we create Gigapipe Cloud? 

With Gigapipe we are taking things back to the _pre-cloud era_. Our goals and principles are simple:

✔️ We don't like metered solutions. Our plans are unmetered.<br/>
✔️ We don't like dynamic pricing. Our service costs are fixed.<br/>
✔️ We don't like vendor lock-ins. Our platform speaks freely.<br/>
✔️ We don't like monopolies. Our products need no aws account.


#### 💎 Independence

Gigapipe is _protocol compatible_ with many projects and products - _without depending on any_. <br/>
Our core engine and APIs are all developed from scratch _("clear room")_ and _opensource_.<br/>
Our APIs are drop-in compatible with Loki, Prometheus, Tempo, Pyroscpe and Opentelemetry.

#### ⚡ Performance

Our stack uses **ClickHouse** + **DuckDB** OLAP engines w/ NVMe storage for fast analytics & scalable performance. 
We develop our stack and extensions confendtly standing on the shoulders of giants.

#### 🍖 Underdog-ness

Our pricing model is different because we are different - and so are our amazing dedicated hosting and VPS partners. 
We don't use AWS. We are not controlled by VC greed. We are made by humans for humans.<br/>

#### ⚖️ Compliance
Our partners infrastructure is compliant with regulations in each supported territory.
