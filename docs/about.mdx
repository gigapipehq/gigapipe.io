# 💜 Polyglot Observability

> Polyglot comes from Greek _polyglōttos_, a combination of **poly** - _"many" or "multi"_ - and **glōtta** for _"language_.

_That's us_. Gigapipe is a Polyglot platform designed around the Observability standards the world already loves 💜

<br/>

### Why did we create Gigapipe? 

Our product principles and core values are simple:

* We don't like metered solutions. Our plans are unlimited.
* We don't like dynamic pricing. Our service cost is fixed.
* We don't like vendor lock-ins. Our platform speaks freely.

_We wanted an all-in-one Observability solution for ourselves, so we made one for everyone._

### 💎 Independence

Our stack is _protocol compatible_ with many projects and products - _without depending on any_. <br/>
Our stack and APIs are developed from scratch and _fully opensource_.

### ⚡ Solid Performance

Our stack leverages the **ClickHouse** and **DuckDB** OLAP engines for storage, fast analytics and scalable performance. <br/>
We develop our extensions standing on the shoulders of giants.

### 🍖 Underdog-ness

Our pricing model is different because we are different - and so are our amazing dedicated hosting and VPS partners. <br/>
We don't run on AWS. We are not VC controlled. We are born and made in EU - by humans for humans.

### ⚖️ Compliance
