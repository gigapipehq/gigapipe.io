#### ☝️ Why did we create Gigapipe? 

> _We needed a powerful all-in-one Observability stack with fast OLAP queries - so we made [qryn](https://qryn.dev)_

Let's take things back to the _pre-cloud era_. Our product goals and principles are simple:

✔️ We don't like metered solutions. Our plans are unmetered.<br/>
✔️ We don't like dynamic pricing. Our service costs are fixed.<br/>
✔️ We don't like vendor lock-ins. Our platform speaks freely.<br/>
✔️ We don't like monopolies. Our products need no aws account.


#### 💎 Independence

Gigapipe is _protocol compatible_ with many projects and products - _without depending on any_. <br/>
Our core engine and APIs are all developed from scratch _("clear room")_ and _opensource_.<br/>
Our APIs are drop-in compatible with Loki, Prometheus, Tempo, Pyroscpe and Opentelemetry.

#### ⚡ Performance

Our stack uses **ClickHouse** + **DuckDB** OLAP engines w/ NVMe storage for fast analytics & scalable performance. 
We develop our stack and extensions confendtly standing on the shoulders of giants.

#### 🍖 Underdog-ness

Our pricing model is different because we are different - and so are our amazing dedicated hosting and VPS partners. 
We don't use AWS. We are not controlled by VC greed. We are made by humans for humans.<br/>

#### ⚖️ Compliance
Our partners infrastructure is compliant with regulations in each supported territory.
